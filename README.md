# local-storage

#### The basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery with local storage app is a simple web application that allows users to save and retrieve text data using the browser's local storage feature.

####  The app consists of an input field where users can enter text, and a button labeled "Save". When the button is clicked, the text entered in the input field is saved to local storage.

#### The saved text is then displayed below the input field, and remains there even after the browser is closed and re-opened. This is because local storage is a persistent storage mechanism, meaning the data stored there remains even after the browser is closed.
